\usage{data(Jamaicatemp)}
\description{
  A (\eqn{13530x 3})-matrix containing spatial december  average temperature (Â°C) observed 
   between 1970-2000 in Jamaica with associated  UTM coordinates. The data has been retrieved using the   package \pkg{geodata} 
that allows to download climate data from WorldClim version 2.1.
UTM coordinates has been obtained using zone 18 and datum WGS84 and rescaled by 1000 to have distances in KM.
